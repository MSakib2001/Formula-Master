    proof: "The general molecular formula for alkanes is CₙH₂ₙ₊₁, where 'n' represents the number of carbon atoms in the alkane molecule. Here's how this formula is derived: \n\n Alkanes are hydrocarbons composed of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms. \n\n Each carbon atom in an alkane forms four sigma (σ) bonds. These bonds are either with other carbon atoms within the chain or with hydrogen atoms. \n\n To understand the relationship between the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms, consider that each carbon atom in the alkane is bonded to two hydrogen atoms (in addition to other carbon atoms). This is because each carbon atom forms two sigma bonds with hydrogen atoms. \n\n Therefore, for each carbon atom (Cₙ) in the alkane, there are 2n hydrogen atoms (2nH) bonded to it. \n\n Additionally, there is one more hydrogen atom at the end of the alkane chain, bonded to the terminal carbon atom.\n\n Combining these observations, the general molecular formula for alkanes becomes CₙH₂ₙ₊₁, reflecting the fact that each carbon atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms, with an extra hydrogen atom at the end of the chain. \n\n So, the correct answer to the question is: \n\n CₙH₂ₙ₊₁",

Here's how this formula is derived: \n\n Alkenes are hydrocarbons composed of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms. \n\n Unlike alkanes, which have single carbon-carbon sigma (σ) bonds, alkenes have at least one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This double bond consists of one sigma (σ) bond and one pi (π) bond. \n\n The presence of the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) reduces the number of hydrogen atoms bonded to each carbon atom compared to alkanes. \n\n Each carbon atom in an alkene forms two sigma (σ) bonds with hydrogen atoms. \n\n Therefore, for each carbon atom (Cₙ) in the alkene, there are 2 hydrogen atoms (2H) bonded to it. \n\n The double bond (C=C) is a shared feature among alkenes, and it does not change the number of carbon atoms or the formula for hydrogen atoms.

This triple bond consists of one sigma (σ) bond and two pi (π) bonds. \n\n The presence of the carbon-carbon triple bond (C≡C) significantly reduces the number of hydrogen atoms bonded to each carbon atom compared to alkanes. \n\n Each carbon atom in an alkyne forms one sigma (σ) bond with hydrogen atoms. \n\n Therefore, for each carbon atom (Cₙ) in the alkyne, there are only 1 hydrogen atom (H) bonded to it. \n\n The triple bond (C≡C) is a distinctive feature of alkynes and leads to the reduced number of hydrogen atoms compared to alkenes and alkanes.

    proof: "The reactivity of an aldehyde is affected by the structure of the alkyl group attached to the carbonyl group. Electron-withdrawing groups, such as an aromatic ring, or electron-donating groups, such as a methyl group, decrease the reactivity of an aldehyde. Formaldehyde has no electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups, so it is the most reactive aldehyde.",
