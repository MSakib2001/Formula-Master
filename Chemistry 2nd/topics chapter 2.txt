Alkane General Formula: CnH2n+2 (e.g., methane, CH4; ethane, C2H6)
Alkene General Formula: CnH2n (e.g., ethene, C2H4; propene, C3H6)
Alkyne General Formula: CnH2n-2 (e.g., ethyne, C2H2; propyne, C3H4)
Functional Groups:
    Alcohol: R-OH (e.g., ethanol, CH3CH2OH)
    Aldehyde: R-C=O (e.g., formaldehyde, HCHO)
    Ketone: R-C=O-R' (e.g., acetone, CH3COCH3)
    Carboxylic Acid: R-COOH (e.g., acetic acid, CH3COOH)
    Amine: R-NH2 (e.g., methylamine, CH3NH2)

Isomerism: Structural isomers have the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements. For example, C4H10 can be butane or isobutane.

Lewis Structures: Diagrams that show the arrangement of atoms and valence electrons in a molecule.

Hybridization: Describes how atomic orbitals mix to form hybrid orbitals for bonding (e.g., sp3 hybridization in methane).

Resonance: The concept that electron delocalization occurs in some molecules, leading to multiple resonance structures.

Electrophile and Nucleophile: Electrophiles are electron-poor species that seek electrons, while nucleophiles are electron-rich species that donate electrons.

Nomenclature: Understanding the rules for naming organic compounds, including alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes.
